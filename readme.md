- **Debouncing** : A simple implementation of the debouncing technique to limit the rate at which a function is executed. here is an input field that allows users to type search queries, and the results are displayed only after a brief pause in typing.

- **Adder using infinite function currying** : An implementation of an adder function using infinite currying, allowing users to add numbers in a chained manner.

- **Polyfill for bind** : A custom implementation of the `bind` method, which allows users to create a new function with a specified `this` context and optional arguments.
